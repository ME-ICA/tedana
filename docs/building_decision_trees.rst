Understanding and building a component selection process
########################################################

This guide is designed for users who want to better understand the mechanics
of the component selection process and people who are considering customizing
their own decision tree or contributing to ``tedana`` code. We have tried to
make this accessible, but it is long. If you just want to better understand
what's in the outputs from ``tedana`` start with
:ref:`classification-output-descriptions`.

``tedana`` involves transforming data into components, currently via ICA, and then
calculating metrics for each component. Each metric has one value per component that
is stored in a ``component_table`` dataframe. This structure is then passed to a
"decision tree" through which a series of binary choices categorize each component
as **accepted** or **rejected**. The time series for the rejected components are
regressed from the data in the `final denoising step`_.

There are a couple of decision trees that are included by default in ``tedana`` but
users can also build their own. This might be useful if one of the default decision
trees needs to be slightly altered due to the nature of a specific data set, if one has
an idea for a new approach to multi-echo denoising, or if one wants to integrate
non-multi-echo metrics into a single decision tree.

.. note::
  We use two terminologies interchangeably.
  The whole process is called "component selection" and much of the code uses
  variants of that phrase
  (e.g. the :class:`~tedana.selection.component_selector.ComponentSelector` class,
  :mod:`~tedana.selection.selection_nodes` for the functions used in selection).
  We call the steps for how to classify components a "decision tree" since each
  step in the selection process branches components into different intermediate
  or final classifications.

******************************************
Expected outputs after component selection
******************************************

During processing, everything is stored in a
:class:`~tedana.selection.component_selector.ComponentSelector` called ``selector``.
The elements of that object are then saved to multiple files.
The file key names are used below the full file names in the
:ref:`output-filename-descriptions`.


General outputs from component selection
========================================

New columns in ``selector.component_table`` and the "ICA metrics tsv" file:

  - classification:
    While the decision table is running, there may also be intermediate
    classification labels, but the final labels are expected to be
    "accepted" or "rejected". There will be a warning if other labels remain.
  - classification_tags:
    Human readable tags that explain why a classification was reached.
    Each component can have no tags (an empty string or n/a), one tag,
    or a comma separated list of tags. These tags may be useful parameters
    for visualizing and reviewing results

``selector.cross_component_metrics`` and "ICA cross component metrics json":
  A dictionary of metrics that are each a single value calculated across components,
  for example, kappa and rho elbows. User or pre-defined scaling factors are
  also stored here. Any constant that is used in the component classification
  processes that isn't pre-defined in the decision tree file should be saved here.

``selector.component_status_table`` and "ICA status table tsv":
  A table where each column lists the classification status of
  each component after each node was run. Columns are only added
  for runs where component statuses can change.
  This is useful for understanding the classification
  path of each component through the decision tree

``selector.tree`` and "ICA decision tree json":
  A copy of the inputted decision tree specification with an added "output" field
  for each node. The output field (see next section) contains information about
  what happened during execution. Of particular note, each output includes a list
  of the metrics used within the node, "node_label", which is a (hopefully) human
  readable brief description of the node's function and, for nodes where component
  classifications can change, "n_false" & "n_true" list who many components
  changed classifications. The inputted parameters include "if_true" and "if_false"
  which specify what changes for each component. These fields can be used to
  construct a visual flow chart or text-based summary of how classifications
  changed for each run.

``selector.tree["used_metrics"]`` and a field in "ICA decision tree json":
  A list of the metrics that were used in the decision tree. Everything in
  ``used_metrics`` should be in either ``necessary_metrics`` or
  ``generated_metrics`` If a used metric isn't in either, a warning message
  will appear. This is a useful check that makes sure every metric used was
  pre-specified.

``selector.tree["classification_tags"]`` and a field in "ICA decision tree json":
  A list of the pre-specified classification tags that could be used in a decision tree.
  Any reporting interface should use this field so that all possible tags are listed
  even if a given tag is not used by any component by the end of the selection process.


Outputs of each decision tree step
==================================

"ICA decision tree json" includes all the information from the specified decision tree
for each "node" or function call. For each node, there is an "outputs" subfield with
information from when the tree was executed.
Each outputs field includes:

- decision_node_idx
    The decision tree functions are run as part of an ordered list.
    This is the positional index (the location of the function in
    the list), starting with index 0.

- used_metrics
    A list of the metrics used in a node of the decision tree

- used_cross_component_metrics
    A list of cross component metrics used in the node of a decision tree

- node_label
    A brief label for what happens in this node that can be used in a decision
    tree summary table or flow chart.

- n_true, n_false
    For decision tree (dec) functions, the number of components that were classified
    as true or false, respectively, in this decision tree step.

- calc_cross_comp_metrics
    For calculation (calc) functions, cross component metrics that were
    calculated in this function. When this is included, each of those
    metrics and the calculated values are also distinct keys in 'outputs'.
    While the cross component metrics table does not include where each component
    was calculated, that information is stored here.

- added_component_table_metrics
    It is possible to add a new metric to the component table during the selection process.
    This is useful if a metric is to be calculated on a subset of components based on what
    happened during previous steps in the selection process. This is **not** recommended,
    but since it was done as part of the original kundu decision tree process defined in
    meica it is possible.


**************************************
Decision trees distributed with tedana
**************************************

Two decision trees are distributed with ``tedana``.
These trees are documented in :doc:`included_decision_trees`.
It might be useful to look at these trees while reading how to develop a custom
decision tree.


*******************************
Defining a custom decision tree
*******************************

Decision trees are stored in json files. The default trees are stored as part of
the tedana code repository in `resources/decision_trees`_. The minimal tree,
minimal.json, is a good example highlighting the structure and steps in a tree. It
may be helpful to look at that tree while reading this section. kundu.json replicates
the decision tree used in MEICA version 2.5, the predecessor to tedana. It is more
complex, but also highlights additional possible functionality in decision trees.

A user can specify another decision tree and link to the tree location when tedana is
executed with the ``--tree`` option. The format is flexible to allow for future
innovations, but be advised that this also allows you to create something with
non-ideal results for the current code. Some criteria will result in an error if
violated, but more will just give a warning. If you are designing or editing a new
tree, look carefully at the warnings.

A decision tree can include two types of nodes or functions.
All functions are currently in :mod:`~tedana.selection.selection_nodes`.

- A decision function will use existing metrics and potentially change the
  classification of the components based on those metrics. By convention, all
  these functions begin with "dec".
- A calculation function will take existing metrics and calculate a value across
  components to be used for classification, for example the kappa and rho elbows.
  By convention, all these functions begin with "calc".
- Nothing prevents a function from both calculating new cross component values and
  applying those values in a decision step, but following this convention should
  hopefully make decision tree specifications easier to follow and results easier
  to interpret.

General information fields
==========================

There are several fields with general information. Some of these store general
information that's useful for reporting results and others store information
that is used to check whether results are plausible & can help avoid mistakes.

- tree_id
    A descriptive name for the tree that will be logged.

- info
    A brief description of the tree for info logging

- report
    A narrative description of the tree that could be used in report logging

- refs
    Publications that should be referenced when this tree is used

- necessary_metrics
    A list of the necessary metrics in the component table that will be used
    by the tree. If a metric doesn't exist then this will raise an error instead
    of executing a tree. (Depending on future code development, this could
    potentially be used to run ``tedana`` by specifying a decision tree and
    metrics are calculated based on the contents of this field.) If a necessary
    metric isn't used, there will be a warning.

- generated_metrics
    An optional initial field. It lists metrics that are to be calculated as
    part of the decision tree's execution. This is used similarly to necessary_metrics
    except, since the decision tree starts before these metrics exist, it won't raise
    an error when these metrics are not found. One might want to calculate a new metric
    if the metric uses only a subset of the components based on previous
    classifications. This does make interpretation of results more confusing, but, since
    this functionality was part of the kundu decision tree, it is included.

- intermediate_classifications
    A list of intermediate classifications (i.e. "provisionalaccept",
    "provisionalreject"). It is very important to pre-specify these because the code
    will make sure only the default classifications ("accepted" "rejected"
    "unclassified") and intermediate classifications are used in a tree. This prevents
    someone from accidentially losing a component due to a spelling error or other
    minor variation in a classification label.

- classification_tags
    A list of acceptable classification tags (i.e. "Likely BOLD", "Unlikely BOLD",
    "Low variance"). This will both be used to make sure only these tags are used in
    the tree and allow programs that interact with the results to see all potential
    tags in one place. Note: "Likely BOLD" is a required tag. If tedana is run and
    none of the components include the "Likely BOLD" tag, then ICA will be repeated
    with a different seed and then the selection process will repeat.


Nodes in the decision tree
==========================

The "nodes" field is an ordered list of elements where each element defines a
node in the decision tree. Each node contains the information to call a function.

All trees should start with a "manual_classification" node that should set all
component classifications to "unclassified" and have "clear_classification_tags"
set to true. There might be special cases where someone might want to violate
these rules, but depending what else happens in preceding code, other functions
will expect both of these columns to exist. This manual_classification step will
make sure those columns are created and initialized.

Every possible path through the tree should result in each component being
classified as 'accepted' or 'rejected' by the time the tree is completed.

There are several key fields for each node:

- "functionname": The exact function name in :mod:`~tedana.selection.selection_nodes` that will be called.
- "parameters": Specifications of all required parameters for the function in functionname
- "kwargs": Specifications for optional parameters for the function in functionname

The only parameter that is used in all functions is ``decide_comps``, which is used to
identify, based on their classifications, the components a function should be applied
to. It can be a single classification, or a comma separated string of classifications.
In addition to the intermediate and default ("accepted", "rejected", "unclassified")
component classifications, this can be "all" for functions that should be applied to
all components regardless of their classifications.

Most decision functions also include ``if_true`` and ``if_false``, which specify how to change
the classification of each component based on whether a decision criterion is true
or false. In addition to the default and intermediate classification options, this can
also be "nochange"
(e.g., for components where a>b is true, "reject", and for components where a>b is false, "nochange").
The optional parameters ``tag_if_true`` and ``tag_if_false``
define the classification tags to be assigned to components.
Currently, the only exceptions are ``manual_classify`` and ``dec_classification_doesnt_exist``,
which use ``new_classification`` to designate the new component classification and
``tag`` (optional) to designate which classification tag to apply.

There are several optional parameters (to include within "kwargs") in every decision
tree function:

- ``custom_node_label``: A brief label for what happens in this node that can be used in
  a decision tree summary table or flow chart. If custom_node_label is not not defined,
  then each function has default descriptive text.
- ``log_extra_report``, ``log_extra_info``: Text for each function call is automatically placed
  in the logger output. In addition to that text, the text in these these strings will
  also be included in the logger with the report or info codes respectively. These
  might be useful to give a narrative explanation of why a step was parameterized a
  certain way.
- ``only_used_metrics``: If true, this function will only return the names of the component
  table metrics that will be used when this function is fully run. This can be used to
  identify all used metrics before running the decision tree.

``"_comments"`` can be used to add a longer explanation about what a node is doing.
This will not be logged anywhere except in the tree, but may be useful to help explain the
purpose of a given node.


********************************
Key parts of selection functions
********************************

There are several expectations for selection functions that are necessary for them to
properly execute.
In :mod:`~tedana.selection.selection_nodes`,
:func:`~tedana.selection.selection_nodes.manual_classify`,
:func:`~tedana.selection.selection_nodes.dec_left_op_right`,
and :func:`~tedana.selection.selection_nodes.calc_kappa_elbow`
are good examples for how to meet these expectations.

Create a dictionary called "outputs" that includes key fields that should be recorded.
The following line should be at the end of each function to retain the output info:
``selector.nodes[selector.current_node_idx]["outputs"] = outputs``

Additional fields can be used to log function-specific information, but the following
fields are common and may be used by other parts of the code:

- "decision_node_idx" (required): the ordered index for the current function in the
  decision tree.
- "node_label" (required): A decriptive label for what happens in the node.
- "n_true" & "n_false" (required for decision functions): For decision functions,
  the number of components labeled true or false within the function call.
- "used_metrics" (required if a function uses metrics): The list of metrics used in
  the function. This can be hard coded, defined by input parameters, or empty.
- "used_cross_component_metrics" (required if a function uses cross component metrics):
  A list of cross component metrics used in the function. This can be hard coded,
  defined by input parameters, or empty.
- "calc_cross_comp_metrics" (required for calculation functions): A list of cross
  component metrics calculated within the function. The key-value pair for each
  calculated metric is also included in "outputs"

Before any data are touched in the function, there should be an
``if only_used_metrics:`` clause that returns ``used_metrics`` for the function
call. This will be useful to gather all metrics a tree will use without requiring a
specific dataset.

Existing functions define ``function_name_idx = f"Step {selector.current_node_idx}: [text of function_name]``.
This is used in logging and is cleaner to initialize near the top of each function.

Each function has code that creates a default node label in ``outputs["node_label"]``.
The default node label may be used in decision tree visualization so it should be
relatively short. Within this section, if there is a user-provided custom_node_label,
that should be used instead.

Calculation nodes should check if the value they are calculating was already calculated
and output a warning if the function overwrites an existing value

Code that adds the text ``log_extra_info`` and ``log_extra_report`` into the appropriate
logs (if they are provided by the user)

After the above information is included,
all functions will call :func:`~tedana.selection.selection_utils.selectcomps2use`,
which returns the components with classifications included in ``decide_comps``
and then runs :func:`~tedana.selection.selection_utils.confirm_metrics_exist`,
which is an added check to make sure the metrics
used by this function exist in the component table.

Nearly every function has a clause like:

.. code-block:: python

  if comps2use is None:
      log_decision_tree_step(function_name_idx, comps2use, decide_comps=decide_comps)
      outputs["n_true"] = 0
      outputs["n_false"] = 0
  else:

If there are no components with the classifications in ``decide_comps``, this logs that
there's nothing for the function to be run on, else continue.

For decision functions, the key variable is ``decision_boolean``, which should be a pandas
dataframe column that is True or False for the components in ``decide_comps`` based on
the function's criteria.
That column is an input to :func:`~tedana.selection.selection_utils.change_comptable_classifications`,
which will update the component_table classifications, update the classification history
in component_status_table, and update the component classification_tags. Components not
in ``decide_comps`` retain their existing classifications and tags.
:func:`~tedana.selection.selection_utils.change_comptable_classifications`
also returns and should assign values to
``outputs["n_true"]`` and ``outputs["n_false"]``. These log how many components were
identified as true or false within each function.

For calculation functions, the calculated values should be added as a value/key pair to
both ``selector.cross_component_metrics`` and ``outputs``.

:func:`~tedana.selection.selection_utils.log_decision_tree_step`
puts the relevant info from the function call into the program's output log.

Every function should end with:

.. code-block:: python

  selector.nodes[selector.current_node_idx]["outputs"] = outputs
  return selector

  functionname.__doc__ = (functionname.__doc__.format(**DECISION_DOCS))

This makes sure the outputs from the function are saved in the class structure and the
class structure is returned. The following line should include the function's name and
is used to make sure repeated variable names are compiled correctly for the API
documentation.

If you have made it this far, congratulations!!! If you follow these steps, you'll be able
to impress your colleagues, friends, and family by designing your very own decision
tree functions.
