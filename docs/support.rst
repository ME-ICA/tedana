All bugs, concerns and enhancement requests for this software can be submitted here: https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana/issues.

If you would like to ask a question about tedana-specific usage or tedana's outputs, please submit a question to `NeuroStars`_ with the `tedana tag`_.

If you would like to ask a general question about multi-echo fMRI, please submit it to `NeuroStars`_ with the `multi-echo tag`_.

Note: All previous tedana-related questions are available under the `multi-echo tag`_.

We will also attempt to archive certain common questions and associate answers in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page.

*******************************
Internal Communication Pathways
*******************************

There are multiple mechanisms for development-related communication, which can lead to confusion.
Here we attempt to clarify when and how each communication pathway should be used:

- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests: Issues and PRs should be the **main avenue of communication** for questions and proposals related to tedana's development.
- Monthly Newsletter: The `monthly newsletter`_ is used to make announcements from the tedana developers to the tedana users. Discussions that start in Issues or PRs may move to the newsletter if they are news-worthy.
- NeuroStars: The NeuroStars forum is to be used by tedana users to ask questions about how to use tedana. tedana's developers may answer usage questions on NeuroStars, but development-related discussions should happen in GitHub Issues and PRs.
- Mattermost: There is a `tedana channel in the BrainHack Mattermost`_. This is primarily used for online discussions during BrainHack-related hackathons (for example, the annual OHBM hackathon), if and when there is a tedana-related project. We also use this channel to redirect to **existing** Issues and PRs, whether open or closed.
