Installation
------------

You'll need to set up a working development environment to use ``tedana``.
To set up a local environment, you will need Python >=3.6 and the following
packages will need to be installed:

- mdp
- nilearn
- nibabel>=2.1.0
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can then install ``tedana`` with:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install tedana
