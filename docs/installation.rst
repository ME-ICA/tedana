Installation
------------

You'll need to set up a working development environment to use ``tedana``.
To set up a local environment, you will need Python >=3.5 and the following
packages will need to be installed:

- nilearn
- nibabel>=2.1.0
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can then install ``tedana`` with:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install tedana

In addition to the Python package, installing ``tedana`` will add the ``tedana``
and ``t2smap`` workflow CLIs to your path.
