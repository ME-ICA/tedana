Considerations for ME-fMRI
##########################
Multi-echo fMRI acquisition sequences and analysis methods are rapidly maturing. 
Someone who has access to a multi-echo fMRI sequence should seriously consider using it. 

The possible costs and benefits of multi-echo fMRI
==================================================
The following are a few points to consider when deciding whether or not to collect multi-echo data.

Possible increase in TR
-----------------------
The one difference with multi-echo is a slight time cost.
For multi-echo fMRI, the shortest echo time (TE) is essentially free since it is collected in the
gap between the RF pulse and the single-echo acquisition.
The second echo tends to roughly match the single-echo TE.
Additional echoes require more time.
For example, on a 3T MRI, if the T2* weighted TE is 30ms for single echo fMRI,
a multi-echo sequence may have TEs of 15.4, 29.7, and 44.0ms.
In this example, the extra 14ms of acquisition time per RF pulse is the cost of multi-echo fMRI.

One way to think about this cost is in comparison to single-echo fMRI.
If a multi-echo sequence has identical spatial resolution and acceleration as a single-echo sequence,
then a rough rule of thumb is that the multi-echo sequence will have 10% fewer slices or 10% longer TR.
Instead of compromising on slice coverage or TR, one can increase acceleration.
If one increases acceleration, it is worth doing an empirical comparison to make sure there
isn't a non-trivial loss in SNR or an increase of artifacts.

Weighted Averaging may lead to an increase in SNR 
-------------------------------------------------
Multiple studies have shown that a
weighted average of the echoes to optimize T2* weighting, sometimes called "optimally combined,"
gives a reliable, modest boost in data quality. 
The optimal combination of echoes can currently be calculated in several software packages including AFNI, 
fMRIPrep, and tedana. In tedana, the weighted
average can be calculated with `t2smap`_ If no other
acquisition compromises are necessary to acquire multi-echo data, this boost is worthwhile. 

Consider the life of the dataset
--------------------------------
If other
compromises are necessary, consider the life of the data set. 
If data is being acquired for a discrete
study that will be acquired, analyzed, and published in a year or two, it might not be worth making
compromises to acquire multi-echo data. 
If a data set is expected to be used for future analyses in later
years, it is likely that more powerful approaches to multi-echo denoising will sufficiently mature and add
even more value to a data set.

Other multi-echo denoising methods, such as MEICA, the predecessor to tedana, have shown the potential for
much greater data quality improvements, as well as the ability to more accurately separate visually similar
signal vs noise, such as scanner based drifts vs slow changes in BOLD signal. 
More powerful methods are
still being improved, and associated algorithms are still being actively developed. 
Users need to have the time and knowledge to look
at the denoising output from every run to make sure denoising worked as intended. 

You may recover signal in areas affected by dropout
---------------------------------------------------
Typical single echo fMRI uses an echo time that is appropriate for signal across most of the brain. 
While this is effective
it also leads to drop out in regions with low :math:T_2^* values. 
This can lead to low or even no signal at all in some areas. 
If your research question could benefit from having either
improved signal characteristics in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral temporal cortex or 
the ventral striatum them multi-echo fMRI may be beneficial. 

Consider the cost of added quality control
------------------------------------------
The developers of ``tedana`` strongly support always examining data for quality concerns, whether
or not multi-echo fMRI is used.
Multi-echo data and denoising are no exception. 
For this purpose, ``tedana`` currently produces basic diagnostic images by default, which can be
inspected in order to determine the quality of denoising. 
`See outputs`_ for more information on these outputs.

Acquisition Parameter Recommendations
=====================================
There is no empirically tested best parameter set for multi-echo acquisition.
The guidelines for optimizing parameters are similar to single-echo fMRI.
For multi-echo fMRI, the same factors that may guide priorities for single echo
fMRI sequences are also relevant.
Choose sequence parameters that meet the priorities of a study with regards to spatial resolution,
spatial coverage, sample rate, signal-to-noise ratio, signal drop-out, distortion, and artifacts.

A minimum of 3 echoes is required for running the current implementation fo TE-dependent denoising in
``tedana``. 
It may be useful to have at least one echo that is earlier and one echo that is later than the
TE one would use for single-echo T2* weighted fMRI.

.. note::
    This is in contrast to the **dual echo** denoising method which uses a very early (~5ms)
    first echo in order to clean data. For more information on this method, see `Bright and Murphy`_ (2013).

.. _Bright and Murphy: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3518782/

More than 3 echoes may be useful, because that would allow for more accurate
estimates of BOLD and non-BOLD weighted fluctuations, but more echoes have an
additional time cost, which would result in either less spatiotemporal coverage
or more acceleration.
Where the benefits of more echoes balance out the additional costs is an open research question.

We are not recommending specific parameter options at this time.
There are multiple ways to balance the slight time cost from the added echoes that have
resulted in research publications.
We suggest new multi-echo fMRI users examine the :ref:`spreadsheet of publications` that use
multi-echo fMRI to identify studies with similar acquisition priorities,
and use the parameters from those studies as a starting point. 
More complete recomendations
and guidelines are discussed in the `appendix`_ of Dipasquale et al, 2017.

    In order to increase the number of contrasts ("echoes") you may need to first increase the TR, shorten the 
    first TE and/or enable in-plane acceleration.

Available multi-echo fMRI sequences for multiple vendors
--------------------------------------------------------

**For Siemens** users, there are two options for Works In Progress (WIPs) Sequences. 
The Center for Magnetic Resonance Research at the University of Minnesota 
provides a custom MR sequence that allows users to collect multiple echoes 
(termed **Contrasts**). 
The sequence and documentation can be `found here`_. For details 
on obtaining a license follow `this link`_. 
By default the number of contrasts is 1, 
yielding a signal echo sequence.
In order to collect multiple echoes, increase number of 
Contrasts on the **Sequence Tab, Part 1** on the MR console. 

In addition, the Martinos Center at Harvard also has a MR sequence available, with the 
details `available here`_. 
The number of echoes can be specified on the **Sequence, Special** tab 
in this sequence. 

**For GE users**, there are currently two sharable pulse sequences:

Multi-echo EPI (MEPI) – Software releases: DV24, MP24 and DV25 (with offline recon)
Hyperband Multi-echo EPI (HyperMEPI) - Software releases: DV26, MP26, DV27, RX27 
(here Hyperband can be deactivated to do simple Multi-echo EPI – online recon)

Please reach out to the GE Research Operation team or each pulse sequence’s 
author to begin the process of obtaining this software. 
More information can be 
found on the `GE Collaboration Portal`_ 

Once logged-in, go to Groups > GE Works-in-Progress you can find the description of the current ATSM (i.e. prototypes)

Multi-echo preprocessing software
---------------------------------

tedana requires data that has already been preprocessed for head motion, alignment, etc.

AFNI can process multi-echo data natively as well as apply tedana denoising through the use of 
**afni_proc.py**. To see various implementations, start with Example 12 in the `afni_proc.py help`_

.. _afni_proc.py help: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/afni_proc.py.html

`fmriprep` can also process multi-echo data, but is currently limited to using the optimally combined
timeseries. 
For more details, see the `fmriprep workflows page`_

.. _fmriprep workflows page: https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/workflows.html

Currently SPM and FSL do not natively support mutli-echo fmri data processing. 

Other software that uses multi-echo fMRI
========================================

``tedana`` represents only one approach to processing multiecho data. 
Currently there are a number of methods that can take advantage of or use the information contain in multi-echo data. 
These include:

`3dMEPFM`_: A multi-echo implemntation of 'paradigm free mapping', that is detection of neural events in the absense of 
a prespecified model. 
By leveraging the information present in multiecho data, changes in relaxation time can be directly esimated and 
more events can be detected. For more information, see the `following paper`_. 

.. _3dMEPFM: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dMEPFM.html
.. _following paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191930669X

`Bayesian approach to denoising`_: An alternative approach to seperating out BOLD and non-BOLD signals within a Bayesian 
framework is currently under development. 

.. _Bayesian approach to denoising: https://ww5.aievolution.com/hbm1901/index.cfm?do=abs.viewAbs&abs=5026

`Multi-echo Group ICA`_: Current approches to ICA just use a single run of data in order to perform denoising. An alternative
approach is to use information from multiple subjects or multiple runs from a single subject in order to improve the 
classification of BOLD and non-BOLD components. 

.. _Multi-echo Group ICA: https://ww5.aievolution.com/hbm1901/index.cfm?do=abs.viewAbs&abs=1286

`Dual Echo Denoising`_: If the first echo can be collected early enough, there are currently methods that take advantage of the 
very limited BOLD weighting at these early echo times.
