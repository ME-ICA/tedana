ICA Components Report
=====================

The reporting page for the tedana decomposition presents a series
of interactive plots designed to help you evaluate the quality of your
analyses. Here you can find both a description of the plots and infromation
on how to take advantage of the interactive functionalities.

Report Structure
----------------

The image below shows a representative report, which has two sections:

    * Summary View: provides an overview of the decomposition and component
      selection results. It includes four different plots.
    * Individual Component View: provides detailed information about an
      individual component (selected in the summary view, see below).

Note: when a report is initially loaded, as no component is selected on the
summary view, the individual component view appears empty.
