ICA Components Report
#####################

The reporting page for the tedana decomposition presents a series
of interactive plots designed to help you evaluate the quality of your
analyses. This page describes the plots forming the reports and well as
information on how to take advantage of the interactive functionalities.
You can also play around with `our demo`_.

Report Structure
================

The image below shows a representative report, which has two sections: a) the summary view,
and b) the individual component view.

.. note::
  When a report is initially loaded, as no component is selected on the
  summary view, the individual component view appears empty.

Summary View
------------
This view provides an overview of the decomposition and component
selection results. It includes four different plots.

* **Kappa/Rho Scatter:** This is a scatter plot of `Kappa` vs. `Rho` features for all components.
  In the plot, each dot represents a different component. The x-axis represents the kappa feature, and the
  y-axis represents the rho feature. These are two of the most
  informative features describing the likelihood of the component
  being BOLD or non-BOLD. Additional information is provided via color
  and size. In particular, color informs about its classification
  status (e.g., accepted, rejected); while size relates to
  the amount of variance explained by the component (larger dot,
  larger variance).

* **Kappa Scree Plot:** This scree plot provides a view of the components ranked by `Kappa`.
  As in the previous plot, each dot represents a component. The color of the dot informs us
  about classification status. In this plot, size is not related to variance explained.

* **Rho Scree Plot:** This scree plot provides a view of the components ranked by `Rho`.
  As in the previous plot, each dot represents a component. The color of the dot informs us
  about classification status. In this plot, size is not related to variance explained.

* **Variance Explained Plot:** This pie plot provides a summary of how much variance is explained
  by each individual component, as well as the total variance explained by each of the three
  classification categories (i.e., accepted, rejected, ignored). In this plot, each component is
  represented as a wedge, whose size is directly related to the amount of variance explained. The
  color of the wedge inform us about the classification status of the component. For this view,
  components are sorted by classification first, and inside each classification group by variance
  explained.

Individual Component View 
-------------------------
This view provides detailed information about an individual 
component (selected in the summary view, see below). It includes three different plots.

* **Time series:** This plot shows the time series associated with a given component
  (selected in the summary view). The x-axis represents time (in units of TR), and the
  y-axis represents signal levels (in arbitrary units). Finally, the color of the trace
  informs us about the component classification status.

* **Component beta map:** This plot shows the map of the beta coefficients associated with
  a given component (selected in the summary view). The colorbar represents the amplitude
  of the beta coefficients.

* **Spectrum:** This plot shows the spectrogram associated with a given component
  (selected in the summary view). The x-axis represents frequency (in Hz), and the
  y-axis represents spectral amplitude.

Reports User Interactions
=========================

As previously mentioned, all summary plots in the report allow user interactions. While the 
Kappa/Rho Scatter plot allows full user interaction (see the toolbar that accompanies the plot
and the example below), the other three plots allow the user to select components and update the
figures.

============  =======  =======================================================
Reset         |Reset|  Resets the data bounds of the plot to their values when
                       the plot was initially created.

Wheel Zoom    |WZoom|  Zoom the plot in and out, centered on the current      
                       mouse location.

Box Zoom      |BZoom|  Define a rectangular region of a plot to zoom to by     
                       dragging the mouse over the plot region.

Crosshair     |CHair|  Draws a crosshair annotation over the plot, centered on
                       the current mouse position                    

Pan           |Pan|    Allows the user to pan a plot by left-dragging a mouse
                       across the plot region.

Hover         |Hover|  If active, the plot displays informational tooltips 
                       whenever the cursor is directly over a plot element.

Selection     |Sel|    Allows user to select components by tapping on the dot
                       or wedge that represents them. Once a component is
                       selected, the plots forming the individual component
                       view update to show component specific information. 

Save          |Save|   Saves an image reproduction of the plot in PNG format.

.. note:: 
  Specific user interactions can be switched on/off by clicking on their associated icon within
  the toolbar of a given plot. Active interactions show an horizontal blue line underneath their
  icon, while inactive ones lack the line.
