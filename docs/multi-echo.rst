What is multi-echo fMRI?
************************

Most echo-planar image (EPI) sequences collect a single brain image following
a radio frequency (RF) pulse, at a rate known as the repetition time (TR).
This typical approach is known as single-echo fMRI.
In contrast, multi-echo (ME) fMRI refers to collecting data at multiple echo times,
resulting in multiple volumes with varying levels of contrast acquired per RF pulse.


.. _multi-echo physics:

The physics of multi-echo fMRI
==============================

Multi-echo fMRI data is obtained by acquiring multiple echo times (commonly called
`TEs`_) for each MRI volume during data collection.
While fMRI signal contains important neural information (termed the blood
oxygen-level dependent, or `BOLD signal`_,
it also contains "noise" (termed non-BOLD signal) caused by things like
participant motion and changes in breathing.
Because the BOLD signal is known to decay at a set rate, collecting multiple
echos allows us to assess non-BOLD.

The image below shows the basic relationship between echo times and the image acquired at
3T (top, A) and 7T (bottom, B). Note that the earliest echo time is the brightest, as the
signal has only had a limited amount of time to decay.
In addition, the latter echo times show areas in which is the signal has decayed completely ('drop out')
due to inhomogeneity in the magnetic field.
By using the information across multiple echoes these images can be combined in
an optimal manner to take advantage of the signal
in the earlier echoes (see :ref:`optimal combination`).

.. image:: /_static/physics_kundu_2017_multiple_echoes.jpg

Adapted from  `Kundu et al. (2017)`_.

In order to classify the relationship between the signal and the echo time we can consider a
single voxel at two timepoints (x and y) and the measured signal measured at three different echo times - :math:`S(TE_n)`.

.. image:: /_static/physics_kundu_2017_TE_dependence.jpg

Adapted from  `Kundu et al. (2017)`_.

For the left column, we are observing a change that we term :math:`{\Delta}{S_0}` - that is a change
in the intercept or raw signal intensity.
A common example of this is participant movement, in which the voxel (which is at a static
location within the scanner) now contains different tissue or even an area outside of the brain.

As we have collected three separate echoes, we can compare the change in signal at each echo time, :math:`{\Delta}{S(TE_n)}`.
For  :math:`{\Delta}{S_0}` we see that this produces a decaying curve.
If we compare this to the original signal, as in :math:`\frac{{\Delta}{S(TE_n)}}{S(TE_n)}`
we see that there is no echo time dependence, as the final plot is a flat line.

In the right column, we consider changes that are related to brain activity.
For example, imagine that the two brain states here (x and y) are a baseline and task activated state respectively.
This effect is a change in in :math:`{\Delta}{R_2^*}` which is equivalent
to the inverse of :math:`{T_2^*}`.
We typically observe this change in signal amplitude occurring over volumes with
the hemodynamic response, while here we are examining the change in signal over echo times.
Again we can plot the difference in the signal between these two states as a function of echo time,
finding that the signal rises and falls.
If we compare this curve to the original signal we find
that the magnitude of the changes is dependent on the echo time.

For a more comprehensive review of these topics and others, see `Kundu et al. (2017)`_.

Why use multi-echo?
===================

There are many potential reasons an investigator would be interested in using multi-echo EPI (ME-EPI).
Among these are the different levels of analysis ME-EPI enables.
Specifically, by collecting multi-echo data, researchers are able to:

**Compare results across different echoes**: currently, field standards are largely set using single-echo EPI.
Because multi-echo is composed of multiple single-echo time series, each of these can be analyzed separately
and compared to one another.

**Combine the results by weighted averaging**: Rather than analyzing single-echo time series separately,
we can combine them into an "optimally combined time series".
For more information on this combination, see :ref:`optimal combination`.
Optimally combined data exhibits higher SNR and improves statistical power of analyses in regions
traditionally affected by drop-out.

**Denoise the data based on information contained in the echoes**: Collecting multi-echo data allows
access to unique denoising methods.
ICA-based denoising methods like ICA-AROMA (`Pruim et al. (2015)`_)
have been shown to significantly improve the quality of cleaned signal.
These methods, however, have comparably limited information, as they are designed to work with single-echo EPI.

``tedana`` is an ICA-based denoising pipeline built especially for
multi-echo data. Collecting multi-echo EPI allows us to leverage all of the information available for single-echo datasets,
as well as additional information only available when looking at signal decay across multiple TEs.
We can use this information to denoise the optimally combined time series.

Considerations for ME-fMRI
==========================

Multi-echo fMRI acquisition sequences and analysis methods are rapidly maturing.
Someone who has access to a multi-echo fMRI sequence should seriously consider using it.


Costs and benefits of multi-echo fMRI
=====================================

The following are a few points to consider when deciding whether or not to collect multi-echo data.


Possible increase in TR
-----------------------

The one difference with multi-echo is a slight time cost.
For multi-echo fMRI, the shortest echo time (TE) is essentially free since it is collected in the
gap between the RF pulse and the single-echo acquisition.
The second echo tends to roughly match the single-echo TE.
Additional echoes require more time.
For example, on a 3T MRI, if the T2* weighted TE is 30ms for single echo fMRI,
a multi-echo sequence may have TEs of 15.4, 29.7, and 44.0ms.
In this example, the extra 14ms of acquisition time per RF pulse is the cost of multi-echo fMRI.

One way to think about this cost is in comparison to single-echo fMRI.
If a multi-echo sequence has identical spatial resolution and acceleration as a single-echo sequence,
then a rough rule of thumb is that the multi-echo sequence will have 10% fewer slices or 10% longer TR.
Instead of compromising on slice coverage or TR, one can increase acceleration.
If one increases acceleration, it is worth doing an empirical comparison to make sure there
isn't a non-trivial loss in SNR or an increase of artifacts.


Weighted averaging may lead to an increase in SNR
-------------------------------------------------

Multiple studies have shown that a weighted average of the echoes to optimize
T2* weighting, sometimes called "optimally combined," gives a reliable, modest
boost in data quality.
The optimal combination of echoes can currently be calculated in several
software packages including AFNI, fMRIPrep, and tedana.
In tedana, the weighted average can be calculated with
:py:func:`tedana.workflows.t2smap_workflow`.
If no other acquisition compromises are necessary to acquire multi-echo data,
this boost is worthwhile.


Consider the life of the dataset
--------------------------------

If other compromises are necessary, consider the life of the data set.
If data is being acquired for a discrete study that will be acquired, analyzed,
and published in a year or two, it might not be worth making compromises to
acquire multi-echo data.
If a data set is expected to be used for future analyses in later years, it is
likely that more powerful approaches to multi-echo denoising will sufficiently
mature and add even more value to a data set.

Other multi-echo denoising methods, such as MEICA, the predecessor to tedana,
have shown the potential for much greater data quality improvements, as well as
the ability to more accurately separate visually similar signal vs noise, such
as scanner based drifts vs slow changes in BOLD signal.
More powerful methods and associated algorithms are
still being actively developed.
Users need to have the time and knowledge to look at the denoising output from
every run to make sure denoising worked as intended.


You may recover signal in areas affected by dropout
---------------------------------------------------

Typical single echo fMRI uses an echo time that is appropriate for signal
across most of the brain.
While this is effective, it also leads to drop out in regions with low
:math:`T_2^*` values.
This can lead to low or even no signal at all in some areas.
If your research question could benefit from having improved signal
characteristics in regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral temporal
cortex or the ventral striatum then multi-echo fMRI may be beneficial.


Consider the cost of added quality control
------------------------------------------

The developers of ``tedana`` strongly support always examining data for quality
concerns, whether or not multi-echo fMRI is used.
Multi-echo data and denoising are no exception.
For this purpose, ``tedana`` currently produces basic diagnostic images by
default, which can be inspected in order to determine the quality of denoising.
See :ref:`outputs` for more information on these outputs.

Available multi-echo fMRI sequences
===================================

We have attempted to compile some basic multi-echo fMRI protocols in an `OSF project`_.
The parameter choices in these protocols run and seem reasonable, but they have
not been optimized for a specific situation.
They are a good starting point for someone designing a study, but should not be
considered canonical.
If you would like to use one of them, please customize it for your own purposes
and make sure to run pilot scans to test your choices.

Siemens
-------

**For Siemens users**, there are two options for Works In Progress (WIPs) Sequences.

* | The Center for Magnetic Resonance Research at the University of Minnesota
  | provides a custom MR sequence that allows users to collect multiple echoes
  | (termed **Contrasts**). The sequence and documentation can be `found here`_.
  | For details on obtaining a license follow `this link`_.
  | By default the number of contrasts is 1, yielding a single-echo sequence.
  | In order to collect multiple echoes, increase number of Contrasts on the
  | **Sequence Tab, Part 1** on the MR console.
* | The Martinos Center at Harvard also has a MR sequence available, with the
  | details `available here`_. The number of echoes can be specified on the
  | **Sequence, Special** tab in this sequence.

Philips
-------

**For Philips users**, sequences can be defined using product software.

Multi-echo EPI (ME-EPI) can be acquired using the product software and can be combined with
SENSE parallel imaging and MultiBand.
The combination with MultiBand requires a SW release >R5.1 and MultiBand functionality to be present.
No default ME-EPI are provided, but existing single-echo EPI sequences from the BOLD fMRI folder can be
modified into multi-echo sequences by increasing the number of echoes.
As a starting point to develop a 3 echo EPI protocol start by opening the default fMRI protocol and
modify the following: increase number of echoes to 3 on the Contrast tab, set SENSE = 3, MB-SENSE = 3,
set to 3mm isotropic voxels and adjust TEs to your preference.


Other available multi-echo MRI sequences
========================================

In addition to ME-fMRI, other MR sequences benefit from acquiring multiple
echoes, including T1-weighted imaging (MEMPRAGE) and susceptibility weighted imaging.
While most of these kinds of sequences fall outside the purview of this documentation,
quantitative T2* mapping is relevant since a baseline T2* map is used in several
processing steps including :ref:`optimal combination`.
While the T2* map estimated directly from fMRI time series is noisy, no current
study quantifies the benefit to optimal combination or tedana denoising if a
higher quality T2* map is used.
Some benefit is likely, so, if a T2* map is independently calculated, it can be
used as an input to many functions in the tedana workflow.

.. warning::
    While tedana allows the input of a T2* map from any source, and a more
    accurate T2* map should lead to better results, this hasn't been
    systematically evaluated yet.

There are many ways to calculate T2* maps, with some using multi-echo acquisitions.
We are not presenting an expansive review of this literature here,
but `Cohen-Adad et al. (2012)`_ and `Ruuth et al. (2019)`_ are good places to start
learning more about this topic.

.. _Cohen-Adad et al. (2012): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.053
.. _Ruuth et al. (2019): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2018.12.006


Acquisition parameter recommendations
=====================================

There is no empirically tested best parameter set for multi-echo fMRI acquisition.
The guidelines for optimizing parameters are similar to single-echo fMRI.
For multi-echo fMRI, the same factors that may guide priorities for single echo
fMRI sequences are also relevant.
Choose sequence parameters that meet the priorities of a study with regards to spatial resolution,
spatial coverage, sample rate, signal-to-noise ratio, signal drop-out, distortion, and artifacts.

A minimum of 3 echoes is required for running the current implementation fo TE-dependent denoising in
``tedana``.
It may be useful to have at least one echo that is earlier and one echo that is later than the
TE one would use for single-echo T2* weighted fMRI.

.. note::
    This is in contrast to the **dual echo** denoising method which uses a very early (~5ms)
    first echo in order to clean data. For more information on this method, see `Bright and Murphy (2013)`_.

.. _Bright and Murphy (2013): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3518782/

More than 3 echoes may be useful, because that would allow for more accurate
estimates of BOLD and non-BOLD weighted fluctuations, but more echoes have an
additional time cost, which would result in either less spatiotemporal coverage
or more acceleration.
Where the benefits of more echoes balance out the additional costs is an open research question.

We are not recommending specific parameter options at this time.
There are multiple ways to balance the slight time cost from the added echoes that have
resulted in research publications.
We suggest new multi-echo fMRI users examine the :ref:`spreadsheet of publications` that use
multi-echo fMRI to identify studies with similar acquisition priorities,
and use the parameters from those studies as a starting point.
More complete recommendations
and guidelines are discussed in the `appendix of Dipasquale et al. (2017)`_.

.. _appendix of Dipasquale et al. (2017): https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173289

.. note::
    In order to increase the number of contrasts ("echoes") you may need to first increase the TR, shorten the
    first TE and/or enable in-plane acceleration.
    For typically used parameters see the **ME-fMRI parameters** section below.

.. _constructing ME-EPI pipelines:

**************************
Processing multi-echo fMRI
**************************

Most multi-echo denoising methods, including ``tedana``,
must be called in the context of a larger ME-EPI preprocessing pipeline.
Two common pipelines which support ME-EPI processing include `fMRIPrep`_ and `afni_proc.py`_.

Users can also construct their own preprocessing pipeline for ME-EPI data from which to call the
multi-echo denoising method of their choice.
There are several general principles to keep in mind when constructing ME-EPI processing pipelines.

In general, we recommend the following:


1. Estimate motion correction parameters from one echo and apply those parameters to all echoes
===============================================================================================

When preparing ME-EPI data for multi-echo denoising with a tool like ``tedana``,
it is important not to do anything that mean shifts the data or otherwise separately
scales the voxelwise values at each echo.

For example, head-motion correction parameters should *not* be calculated and applied at an
individual echo level (see above).
Instead, we recommend that researchers apply the same transforms to all echoes in an ME-EPI series.
That is, that they calculate head motion correction parameters from one echo
and apply the resulting transformation to all echoes.


2. Perform slice timing correction and motion correction **before** multi-echo denoising
========================================================================================

Similarly to single-echo EPI data, slice time correction allows us to assume that voxels across
slices represent roughly simultaneous events.
If the TR is slow enough to necessitate slice-timing (i.e., TR >= 1 sec., as a rule of thumb), then
slice-timing correction should be done before ``tedana``.
This is because slice timing differences may impact echo-dependent estimates.

The slice time is generally defined as the excitation pulse time for each slice.
For single-echo EPI data, that excitation time would be the same regardless of the echo time,
and the same is true when one is collecting multiple echoes after a single excitation pulse.
Therefore, we suggest using the same slice timing for all echoes in an ME-EPI series.


3. Perform distortion correction, spatial normalization, smoothing, and any rescaling or filtering **after** denoising
======================================================================================================================

Any step that will alter the relationship of signal magnitudes between echoes should occur after denoising and combining
of the echoes. For example, if echo is separately scaled by its mean signal over time, then resulting intensity gradients
and the subsequent calculation of voxelwise T2* values will be distorted or incorrect. See the description of
``tedana``'s :doc:`approach <\approach>` for more details on how T2* values are calculated. An agressive temporal filter
(i.e. a 0.1Hz low pass filter) or spatial smoothing could similarly distort the relationship between the echoes at each
time point.

.. note::
    We are assuming that spatial normalization and distortion correction, particularly non-linear normalization methods
    with higher order interpolation functions, are likely to distort the relationship between echoes while rigid body
    motion correction would linearly alter each echo in a similar manner. This assumption has not yet been empirically
    tested and an affine normalzation with bilinear interpolation may not distort the relationship between echoes.
    Additionally, there are benefits to applying only one spatial transform to data rather than applying one spatial
    transform for motion correction and a later transform for normalization and distortion correction. Our advice
    against doing normalization and distortion correction is a conservative choice and we encourage additional
    research to better understand how these steps can be applied before denoising.

Multi-echo preprocessing software
=================================

tedana requires data that has already been preprocessed for head motion, alignment, etc.

AFNI can process multi-echo data natively as well as apply tedana denoising through the use of
**afni_proc.py**. To see various implementations, start with Example 12 in the `afni_proc.py help`_

.. _afni_proc.py help: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/afni_proc.py.html

`fmriprep` can also process multi-echo data, but is currently limited to using the optimally combined
timeseries.
For more details, see the `fmriprep workflows page`_ and :ref:`collecting fMRIPrepped data`.

.. _fmriprep workflows page: https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/workflows.html

Currently SPM and FSL do not natively support multi-echo fmri data processing.


Other software that uses multi-echo fMRI
========================================

``tedana`` represents only one approach to processing multi-echo data.
Currently there are a number of methods that can take advantage of or use the
information contained in multi-echo data.
These include:

* | `3dMEPFM`_: A multi-echo implementation of 'paradigm free mapping', that is
  | detection of neural events in the absence of a prespecified model. By
  | leveraging the information present in multi-echo data, changes in relaxation
  | time can be directly estimated and more events can be detected.
  | For more information, see the `following paper`_.
* | `Bayesian approach to denoising`_: An alternative approach to separating out
  | BOLD and non-BOLD signals within a Bayesian framework is currently under
  | development.
* | `Multi-echo Group ICA`_: Current approaches to ICA just use a single run of
  | data in order to perform denoising. An alternative approach is to use
  | information from multiple subjects or multiple runs from a single subject
  | in order to improve the classification of BOLD and non-BOLD components.
* | `Dual Echo Denoising`_: If the first echo can be collected early enough,
  | there are currently methods that take advantage of the very limited BOLD
  | weighting at these early echo times.
* | `qMRLab`_: This is a MATLAB software package for quantitative magnetic
  | resonance imaging. While it does not support ME-fMRI, it does include methods
  | for estimating T2*/S0 from high-resolution, complex-valued multi-echo GRE
  | data with correction for background field gradients.
