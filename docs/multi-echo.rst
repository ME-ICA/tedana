Multi-echo fMRI
===============
In multi-echo (ME) fMRI, data are acquired for multiple echo times, resulting in
multiple time series for each voxel.

The physics of multi-echo fMRI
------------------------------
Multi-echo fMRI data is obtained by acquiring multiple TEs (commonly called
`echo times`_) for each MRI volume
during data collection.
While fMRI signal contains important neural information (termed the blood
oxygen-level dependent, or `BOLD signal`_,
it also contains "noise" (termed non-BOLD signal) caused by things like
participant motion and changes in breathing.
Because the BOLD signal is known to decay at a set rate, collecting multiple
echos allows us to assess whether components of the fMRI signal are BOLD- or
non-BOLD.
For a comprehensive review, see `Kundu et al. (2017)`_.

Why use multi-echo?
-------------------
ME-EPI exhibits higher SNR and improves statistical power of analyses.
