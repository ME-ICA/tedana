              Free Mapping (ME-SPFM). Assuming a linear dependence of the BOLD
              percent signal change on the echo time (TE) and using
              sparsity-promoting regularized least squares estimation, ME-SPFM
              yields voxelwise time-varying estimates of the changes in the
              apparent transverse relaxation ($\Delta$R) without prior
              knowledge of the timings of individual BOLD events. Our results
              in multi-echo fMRI data collected during a multi-task
              event-related paradigm at 3 Tesla demonstrate that the maps of R
              changes obtained with ME-SPFM at the times of the stimulus trials
              show high spatial and temporal concordance with the activation
              maps and BOLD signals obtained with standard model-based
              analysis. This method yields estimates of $\Delta$R having
              physiologically plausible values. Owing to its ability to blindly
              detect events, ME-SPFM also enables us to map $\Delta$R
              associated with spontaneous, transient BOLD responses occurring
              between trials. This framework is a step towards deciphering the
              dynamic nature of brain activity in naturalistic paradigms,
              resting-state or experimental paradigms with unknown timing of
              the BOLD events.",

              level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is widely used for
              noninvasively studying brain functional networks. Recent findings
              have indicated, however, that even small ($\leq$1 mm) amounts of
              head movement during scanning can disproportionately bias
              connectivity estimates, despite various preprocessing efforts.
              Further complications for interregional connectivity estimation
              from time domain signals include the unaccounted reduction in
              BOLD degrees of freedom related to sensitivity losses from high
              subject motion. To address these issues, we describe an
              integrated strategy for data acquisition, denoising, and
              connectivity estimation. This strategy builds on our previously
              published technique combining data acquisition with multiecho
              (ME) echo planar imaging and analysis with spatial independent
              component analysis (ICA), called ME-ICA, which distinguishes BOLD
              (neuronal) and non-BOLD (artifactual) components based on linear
              echo-time dependence of signals-a characteristic property of BOLD
              T*2 signal changes. Here we show for 32 control subjects that
              this method provides a physically principled and nearly
              operator-independent way of removing complex artifacts such as
              motion from resting state data. We then describe a robust
              estimator of functional connectivity based on interregional
              correlation of BOLD-independent component coefficients. This
              estimator, called independent components regression, considerably
              simplifies statistical inference for functional connectivity
              because degrees of freedom equals the number of independent
              coefficients. Compared with traditional connectivity estimation
              methods, the proposed strategy results in fourfold improvements
              in signal-to-noise ratio, functional connectivity analysis with
              improved specificity, and valid statistical inference with
              nominal control of type 1 error in contrasts of connectivity

  abstract = "A central challenge in the fMRI based study of functional
              connectivity is distinguishing neuronally related signal
              fluctuations from the effects of motion, physiology, and other
              nuisance sources. Conventional techniques for removing nuisance
              effects include modeling of noise time courses based on external
              measurements followed by temporal filtering. These techniques
              have limited effectiveness. Previous studies have shown using
              multi-echo fMRI that neuronally related fluctuations are Blood
              Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals that can be characterized
              in terms of changes in R(2)* and initial signal intensity (S(0))
              based on the analysis of echo-time (TE) dependence. We
              hypothesized that if TE-dependence could be used to differentiate
              BOLD and non-BOLD signals, non-BOLD signal could be removed to
              denoise data without conventional noise modeling. To test this
              hypothesis, whole brain multi-echo data were acquired at 3 TEs
              and decomposed with Independent Components Analysis (ICA) after
              spatially concatenating data across space and TE. Components were
              analyzed for the degree to which their signal changes fit models
              for R(2)* and S(0) change, and summary scores were developed to
              characterize each component as BOLD-like or not BOLD-like. These
              scores clearly differentiated BOLD-like ``functional network''
              components from non BOLD-like components related to motion,
              pulsatility, and other nuisance effects. Using non BOLD-like
              component time courses as noise regressors dramatically improved
              seed-based correlation mapping by reducing the effects of high
              and low frequency non-BOLD fluctuations. A comparison with
              seed-based correlation mapping using conventional noise
              regressors demonstrated the superiority of the proposed technique
              for both individual and group level seed-based connectivity
              analysis, especially in mapping subcortical-cortical
              connectivity. The differentiation of BOLD and non-BOLD components
              based on TE-dependence was highly robust, which allowed for the
              identification of BOLD-like components and the removal of non
              BOLD-like components to be implemented as a fully automated
              procedure.",

  abstract  = "In an age where the amount of data collected from brain imaging
               is increasing constantly, it is of critical importance to
               analyse those data within an accepted framework to ensure proper
               integration and comparison of the information collected. This
               book describes the ideas and procedures that underlie the
               analysis of signals produced by the brain. The aim is to
               understand how the brain works, in terms of its functional
               architecture and dynamics. This book provides the background and
               methodology for the analysis of all types of brain imaging data,
               from functional magnetic resonance imaging to
               magnetoencephalography. Critically, Statistical Parametric
               Mapping provides a widely accepted conceptual framework which
               allows treatment of all these different modalities. This rests
               on an understanding of the brain's functional anatomy and the
               way that measured signals are caused experimentally. The book
               takes the reader from the basic concepts underlying the analysis
               of neuroimaging data to cutting edge approaches that would be
               difficult to find in any other source. Critically, the material
               is presented in an incremental way so that the reader can
               understand the precedents for each new development. This book
               will be particularly useful to neuroscientists engaged in any
               form of brain mapping; who have to contend with the real-world
               problems of data analysis and understanding the techniques they
               are using. It is primarily a scientific treatment and a didactic
               introduction to the analysis of brain imaging data. It can be
               used as both a textbook for students and scientists starting to
               use the techniques, as well as a reference for practicing
               neuroscientists. The book also serves as a companion to the
               software packages that have been developed for brain imaging
               data analysis. An essential reference and companion for users of
               the SPM software Provides a complete description of the concepts

              (MB) imaging and multi-echo (ME) imaging. In MB imaging multiple
              slices are acquired simultaneously leading to significant
              increases in temporal and spatial resolution. Multi-echo imaging
              enables multiple echoes to be acquired in one shot, where the ME
              images can be used to denoise the BOLD time series and increase
              BOLD sensitivity. In this study, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI)
              data were collected using a combined MBME sequence and compared
              to an MB single echo sequence. In total, 29 subjects were imaged,
              and 18 of them returned within two weeks for repeat imaging.
              Participants underwent one MBME scan with three echoes and one MB
              scan with one echo. Both datasets were processed using standard
              denoising and advanced denoising. Advanced denoising included
              multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA) for the MBME
              data and ICA-AROMA for the MB data. Resting state functional
              connectivity (RSFC) was evaluated using both selective seed-based
              and whole grey matter (GM) region-of-interest (ROI) based
              approaches. The reproducibility of connectivity metrics was also
              analyzed in the repeat subjects. In addition, functional
              connectivity density (FCD), a data-driven approach that counts
              the number of significant connections, both within a local
              cluster and globally, with each voxel was analyzed. Regardless of
              the standard or advanced denoising technique, all seed-based RSFC
              was significantly higher for MBME compared to MB. Much more GM
              ROI combinations showed significantly higher RSFC for MBME vs.
              MB. Reproducibility, evaluated using the dice coefficient was
              significantly higher for MBME relative to MB data. Finally, FCD
              was also higher for MBME vs. MB data. This study showed higher
              RSFC for MBME vs. MB data using selected seed-based, whole GM
              ROI-based, and data-driven approaches. Reproducibility found also
              higher for MBME data. Taken together, these results indicate that

              respiratory variation (respiratory volume per time; RVT),

              a strong linear relationship with resting-state BOLD signals

              variance due to nonneurobiological signals. Multiecho fMRI
              techniques are a promising means for making such distinctions
              based on signal decay properties. Here, we report that multiecho
              fMRI techniques enable excellent removal of certain kinds of
              artifactual variance, namely, spatially focal artifacts due to
              motion. By removing these artifacts, multiecho techniques reveal
              frequent, large-amplitude blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
              signal changes present across all gray matter that are also
              linked to motion. These whole-brain BOLD signals could reflect
              widespread neural processes or other processes, such as
              alterations in blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO) due
              to ventilation changes. By acquiring multiecho data while
              monitoring breathing, we demonstrate that whole-brain BOLD
              signals in the resting state are often caused by changes in
              breathing that co-occur with head motion. These widespread
              respiratory fMRI signals cannot be isolated from neurobiological
              signals by multiecho techniques because they occur via the same
              BOLD mechanism. Respiratory signals must therefore be removed by
              some other technique to isolate neurobiological covariance in
              fMRI time series. Several methods for removing global artifacts
              are demonstrated and compared, and were found to yield fMRI time
              series essentially free of motion-related influences. These
              results identify two kinds of motion-associated fMRI variance,
              with different physical mechanisms and spatial profiles, each of
              which strongly and differentially influences functional

              dependent (BOLD) signals in different regions of the brain ``at
              rest'' as an indicator of synchronous neural activity. Since this
              measure relies on the temporal correlation of fMRI signal changes
              between different parts of the brain, any non-neural
              activity-related process that affects the signals will influence
              the measure of functional connectivity, yielding spurious
              results. To understand the sources of these resting-state fMRI
              confounds, this article describes the origins of the BOLD signal
              in terms of MR physics and cerebral physiology. Potential
              confounds arising from motion, cardiac and respiratory cycles,

              addition to pointing out the advantages and limitations in their
              application. Since motion-related and physiological noise
              fluctuations are two of the main noise components of the signal,
              techniques targeting their removal are primarily addressed,
              including both data-driven approaches and using external
              recordings. Data-driven approaches, which are less specific in

              fluctuations, are mainly based on data decomposition techniques
              such as principal and independent component analysis.

  abstract = "Echo time dependence of the BOLD sensitivity is an important
              topic in fMRI whenever brain regions are considered where the EPI
              data quality suffers from susceptibility gradients. Here, an fMRI
              study is presented showing that a reduced echo time EPI sequence
              significantly enhances the statistical inference in subcortical
              (limbic) brain regions, with special focus on the amygdala. As a
              consequence, to facilitate whole-brain fMRI with optimal echo
              times, a sequence with slice-dependent echo time is demonstrated
              with a focus on structures suffering from susceptibility changes.
              The applicability of this method is shown in a second fMRI study
              aimed at both, cortical, and limbic brain regions. The results
              are in good agreement with theoretical descriptions of the BOLD
              sensitivity under the influence of susceptibility gradients.",

  abstract = "Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR), the responsiveness of blood
              vessels to a vasodilatory stimulus, is an important indicator of
              cerebrovascular health. Assessing CVR with fMRI, we can measure
              the change in the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response
              induced by a change in CO2 pressure (\%BOLD/mmHg). However, there
              exists a temporal offset between the recorded CO2 pressure and
              the local BOLD response, due to both measurement and
              physiological delays. If this offset is not corrected for,
              voxel-wise CVR values will not be accurate. In this paper, we
              propose a framework for mapping hemodynamic lag in breath-hold
              fMRI data. As breath-hold tasks drive task-correlated head motion
              artifacts in BOLD fMRI data, our framework for lag estimation
              fits a model that includes polynomial terms and head motion
              parameters, as well as a shifted variant of the CO2 regressor
              ($\pm$9 s in 0.3 s increments), and the hemodynamic lag at each
              voxel is the shift producing the maximum total model R2 within
              physiological constraints. This approach is evaluated in 8
              subjects with multi-echo fMRI data, resulting in robust maps of
              hemodynamic delay that show consistent regional variation across
              subjects, and improved contrast-to-noise compared to methods
              where motion regression is ignored or performed earlier in
              preprocessing.Clinical Relevance- We map hemodynamic lag using
              breathhold fMRI, providing insight into vascular transit times
              and improving the regional accuracy of cerebrovascular reactivity

  abstract = "Performing a BOLD functional MRI (fMRI) acquisition during
              breath-hold (BH) tasks is a non-invasive, robust method to
              estimate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). However, movement and
              breathing-related artefacts caused by the BH can substantially
              hinder CVR estimates due to their high temporal collinearity with
              the effect of interest, and attention has to be paid when
              choosing which analysis model should be applied to the data. In
              this study, we evaluate the performance of multiple analysis
              strategies based on lagged general linear models applied on
              multi-echo BOLD fMRI data, acquired in ten subjects performing a
              BH task during ten sessions, to obtain subjectspecific CVR and
              haemodynamic lag estimates. The evaluated approaches range from
              conventional regression models including drifts and motion
              timecourses as nuisance regressors applied on singleecho or
              optimally-combined data, to more complex models including
              regressors obtained from multi-echo independent component
              analysis with different grades of orthogonalization in order to
              preserve the effect of interest, i.e. the CVR. We compare these
              models in terms of their ability to make signal intensity changes
              independent from motion, as well as the reliability as measured
              by voxelwise intraclass correlation coefficients of both CVR and
              lag maps over time. Our results reveal that a conservative
              independent component analysis model applied on the
              optimally-combined multi-echo fMRI signal offers the largest
              reduction of motion-related effects in the signal, while yielding
              reliable CVR amplitude and lag estimates, although a conventional
              regression model applied on the optimally-combined data results
              in similar estimates. This work demonstrate the usefulness of
              multi-echo based fMRI acquisitions and independent component
              analysis denoising for precision mapping of CVR in single
              subjects based on BH paradigms, fostering its potential as a
              clinically-viable neuroimaging tool for individual patients. It
              also proves that the way in which data-driven regressors should
              be incorporated in the analysis model is not straight-forward due
              to their complex interaction with the BH-induced BOLD response.
